=== ZOO-Project 1.7.0 release notes ===

This new ZOO-Project release contains new features and fixes,including two brand new supports: R language and HPC.

For people familiar with the ZOO-Project the R language will be very easy to use for developers willing to develop their services in this language. For more information about this new support, please refer to [http://zoo-project.org/docs/services/howtos.html#r the official documentation].

On the other hand, the HPC support is something totally new in the ZOO-Project ecosystem. Usually, the ZOO-Kernel is handling the execution of a service on its own but, using this HPC support,  it is now possible to execute asynchronously WPS services using a remote scheduler. This support has been implemented to support Slurm as the remote scheduler and the communication with the host is made using SSH.

==== Upgrade notes: ====

A specific <tt>memory</tt> parameter has been added to the <tt>main.cfg</tt> file. With it, you can now decide if you want every input data to be loaded in memory or to be stored as files. For information about this option, please refer to [http://zoo-project.org/docs/kernel/configuration.html#main-section the official documentation].

A specific <tt>[metadb]</tt> section can be added to the <tt>main.cfg</tt> file to search for WPS Services metadata in a database. For more information about this support, please refer to [http://zoo-project.org/docs/kernel/configuration.html#metadb-section the official documentation].
