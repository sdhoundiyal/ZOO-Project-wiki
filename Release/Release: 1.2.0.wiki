== For developers ==

<pre>
#sh
svn checkout http://svn.zoo-project.org/svn/trunk zoo
</pre>

For registred developers, you can use SSH or HTTPS protocol. Information on how to setup your https account can be found [http://zoo-project.org/trac/wiki/ZooDevDocumentation here]. For those using SSH, as the server waiting incoming SSH connexions on the 1046 port, you'll have to edit your <tt>~/.subversion/config</tt> file to add a tunnel. Let us name it as <tt>zoossh</tt>, you can then use the following command :

<pre>
#sh
# sed "s:\[tunnels\]:\[tunnels\]\nzoossh = /usr/bin/ssh -p 1046:g" -i ~/.subversion/config
# svn co svn+zoossh://svn.zoo-project.org/var/svn/repos/trunk zoo-project
</pre>
