## For developers {#for_developers}

    #sh
    svn checkout http://svn.zoo-project.org/svn/trunk zoo

For registred developers, you can use SSH or HTTPS protocol. Information
on how to setup your https account can be found
[here](http://zoo-project.org/trac/wiki/ZooDevDocumentation). For those
using SSH, as the server waiting incoming SSH connexions on the 1046
port, you\'ll have to edit your `~/.subversion/config` file to add a
tunnel. Let us name it as `zoossh`, you can then use the following
command :

    #sh
    # sed "s:\[tunnels\]:\[tunnels\]\nzoossh = /usr/bin/ssh -p 1046:g" -i ~/.subversion/config
    # svn co svn+zoossh://svn.zoo-project.org/var/svn/repos/trunk zoo-project
