2\. ZOO-Booth at FOSS4G2010 and Funding for ZOO-Promotions in 2010

A ZOO booth at FOSS4G 2010 has been seen as too much time consuming and
expensive. Instead the focus for publicity should be on t-shirts,
brochures, demos, Live USB sticks and other promotional goods, but it
has been postponed to the next meeting to vote about it. Until then
ideas and budget for promotional goods should be discussed in the
mailing list.

    Vote for NO ZOO-Booth at FOSS4G 2010
    Nicolas BOZON: +1
    Jeff McKenna: +1
    Gérald Fenoy: +1
    Daniel Kastl: +1
    Venkatesh Raghavan: +1
    Hayashi: +1

3\. Discuss about preparing document for PSC guidelines

Daniel Kastl proposed to take the pgRouting PSC guideline (based on
Mapserver PSC) as a base, and he and Venkatesh Raghavan will work on the
document and make changes where necessary and simplify where possible.

    Vote for modified version of the pgRouting PSC guideline and place them in TRAC wiki or SVN:
    Nicolas BOZON: +1
    Jeff McKenna: +1
    Gérald Fenoy: +1
    Daniel Kastl: +1
    Venkatesh Raghavan: +1
    Hayashi: +1

4\. About Using IRC Channel for future meetings

Jeff McKenna and Daniel Kastl are in favor of using IRC (\#zoo-project
channel) to make PSC meetings transparent and available also for non-PSC
members. Others don\'t care as long as it works. The only issue seems to
be, if there is an IRC client available for Hayashi-san\'s Android
phone. Until this isn\'t clarified Skype will be used.

    Votes for using IRC instead of Skype
    Nicolas BOZON: +0
    Jeff McKenna: +1
    Gérald Fenoy: +0
    Daniel Kastl: +1
    Venkatesh Raghavan: +0

5\. Next meeting schedule The schedule as below was decided on the
ZOO-PSC ML
<http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?year=2010&month=4&day=21&hour=13&min=0&sec=0>

6\. Post meeting clarifications on ZOO-PSC ML *Venka: As agreed upon in
the PSC ML before the March PSC Meeting, ZOO-Kernel will be licensed
under MIT/X11. ZOO-API may also be released under same MIT/X11 license.*

\'\'Nick: ZOO Kernel and ZOO API will be both released under MIT/X-11
according to plans, as Kernel was coded from scratch by GeoLabs, and API
was coded from scratch by 3LIZ.
