== ZOO-Project Developper documentation ==

You'll find here informations about the access granted to you when you are a developper.

First you get an SSH account which give you access to the ZOO-Project.org server through the 1046 port. To connect use the following:

<pre>
ssh -p 1046 <DEV_USER>@zoo-project.org 
</pre>

Using this account you can access the ZOO-Project SVN server using SSH, configuring a specific tunnel in your local <tt>.subversion/config</tt> file.

You can configure your https access to the SVN server using the following commands on the ZOO-Project.org server:

<pre>
htpasswd /var/svn/repos/conf/svnusers <DEV_USER>
</pre>

You can now access the SVN server using https protocol using your <tt><DEV_USER></tt>.
