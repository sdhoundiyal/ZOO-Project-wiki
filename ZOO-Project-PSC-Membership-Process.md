## Background History

ZOO-Project PSC (Project Steering Committee) was formed in **March 2010** with **10 initial members** who expressed interest in serving as PSC members. There was no call for nomination or voting process for the initial PSC and the membership was based on confirming the participation of potential members and nominating them to be on to the PSC. [Gérald Fenoy](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/User:Djay) was elected as the initial Chair of ZOO-Project and the [PSC Guidelines](http://zoo-project.org/trac/wiki/PSC/process) were formulated at the second PSC meeting held on **2010-04-21**. The PSC functioned with the initial **10 PSC members** till **2020-10-04**. A new PSC was established after confirming the continued participation of the initial members and requesting the participation of new PSC members on the ZOO-PSC mailing list. The new PSC was announced on **2020-10-05** with **5 members** from the initial PSC continuing with Gérald Fenoy elected as Chair. A new member was nominated in the Second ZOO-Project PSC Meeting on **2020-12-10**. Presently, the ZOO-PSC functions with **6 nominated members** [1]. 

In summary, the steps for the PSC membership process between **2010-2020** has been as follows:
- Proposal of members by existing PSC
- Obtain the consent of the new member
- Voting by existing PSC to confirm a new member
- Election of the Chair by the PSC members from amongst the PSC members
