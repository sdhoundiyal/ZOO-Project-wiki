=== Proposed Time and Date ===

Thursday, 17 June 2021 at https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?year=2021&month=6&day=17&hour=12&min=0&sec=0&msg=ZOO-Project+PSC+Meeting

=== Agenda ===
* Review PSC meeting 26 (https://github.com/ZOO-Project/ZOO-Project/wiki/PSC:-meetings:-PSCMeet26) minutes
* OGC API - Process Code Sprint report and demo
* Discuss: Reintegration of the MapServer support within OGC API - Processes (despite what was discussed before, exposing GetMap, GetFeature and GetCoverage requests would still make sense for more use cases than expected)
* Discuss the following option: stop relying on OGC draft release for our ZOO-Project releases
* Discuss possibility of releasing the current code and make sure to have the commit corresponding to the draft version as it is the day of the release
* Updates on ZOO-Project incubation status
* Update about ZOO-Project documentation status
