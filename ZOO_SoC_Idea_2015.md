Enter ideas for development projects here. \'Note these are just
suggestions - students are welcome to propose projects based on their
own interests that involve the ZOO-Project.

### Zoo-Project powered Java through JGrasstools {#zoo_project_powered_java_through_jgrasstools}

#### Involved projects {#involved_projects}

-   [ZOO-Project](http://www.zoo-project.org/)
-   [JGrasstools](http://moovida.github.io/jgrasstools/)

#### Proposal

The Zoo-project is a solid WPS server that works well with many
different programming languages. The Java bindings have never been
tested in advanced configurations and complex data types. The
JGrasstools project is a modular processing library and its highly
annotated nature makes it possible to adapt quite easily to other
toolboxes. One example has been the adaptation to the Geotools Process
API. The JGrasstools project, as well as other java based projects (as
JTS and even geotools) would benefit a lot from the possibility to be
used within a WPS environment. The proposal is to bring the Java binding
to a mature lavel and validate them by integrating the JGrasstools
libraries. This will allow them to work inside the Zoo-project and serve
its modules under the WPS standard.

#### Mentors

co-mentors.
