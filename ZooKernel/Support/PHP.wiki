== What's a ZOO PHP Service Provider looks like ?  ==

It is a combinaison of a PHP script and multiple metadata configuration files (zcfg).

== First example ==

Our first example is a basic HelloWold service which outputs a string containing an inputed string and a Hello World message.

The code can be found [http://trac.zoo-project.org/browser/trunk/zoo-services/hello-php/hello.php here].

The metadata configuration file is [http://trac.zoo-project.org/browser/trunk/zoo-services/hello-php/cgi-env/HelloPHP.zcfg here].

== How to deploy such a Service Provider ==

Simply copy the zcfg and the PHP script in your cgi-bin directory or whatever metapath you want.
