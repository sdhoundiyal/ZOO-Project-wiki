# ZOO-Community _@_ GSoC _with_ OSGeo

We are floating the project ideas for [ZOO-Project](https://github.com/ZOO-Project/ZOO-Project) on this wiki. The project ideas are explained in detail below:

_Idea(s):_

## **ZOO-Project**

1. ### Advancing the ZOO-Project testing capabilities.

Duration - 150 hrs

The ZOO-Project is a solid WPS server able to handle services implemented in various different programming languages. The existing ZOO-Kernel supports C, C++, and JS implementations. With this project, the objective is to design new tests for the ZOO-Project software. 

**Mentor**: [Sandeepan Dhoundiyal](https://www.osgeo.org/member/dhoundiyal/), [Gérald Fenoy](https://www.osgeo.org/member/gerald-fenoy/), [Rajat Shinde](https://www.osgeo.org/member/shinde/), 

**Difficulty**: Moderate

**Pre-requisites**: Java, Python, JavaScript, C++, OGC standards

**Expected Outcome**: ZOO-Project tests suite.

**Idea in Detail**: We are expecting the following deliverables from the project:

-   Recently, we announced ZOO-Project 2.0 release. The selected contributor is expected to design the test suite for the software stack. This is an open-ended project and requires understanding of the entire project.

-   The contributor is expected to:

    -    Create a unit-test management framework for the ZOO-Project.

    -    Identify key capabilities of the ZOO-Project.

    -    Implement unit-tests for the the key capabilites.

**Test**: Contributors interested in working on this project idea must successfully perform the following tasks in the Contributor application period.

-   Test for the understanding of Github (Version Control)

    -   Fork the [ZOO-Project](https://github.com/ZOO-Project/ZOO-Project) Github repository and create a task list in the issues section of the repository.

    -   Create a pull request to the [ZOO-Project](https://github.com/ZOO-Project/ZOO-Project) repository with your code.

    The link to the Github repository should be mentioned in the final Contributor proposal for the Google Summer of Code 2024.

-   Test for understanding of unit-testing
    
    - Compile a short report describing how a unit-test would be added to the testing suite you will put in place.


The Contributors are encouraged to reach out to[  Gérald Fenoy](https://www.osgeo.org/member/gerald-fenoy/) and[  Rajat Shinde](https://www.osgeo.org/member/shinde/) for any queries regarding the above-mentioned test. The queries can also be posted to OSGeo SOC mailing list - soc(AT)lists(DOT)osgeo(DOT)org or the [ZOO Project Slack channel](http://zoo-project.slack.com).
