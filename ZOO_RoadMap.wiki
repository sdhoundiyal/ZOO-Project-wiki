This is a proposal for setting up ZOO roadmap and versions. It will be voted by PSC soon.

a) ZOO-Kernel (presently Version 1.0) will have a
   code freeze on 1st Dec 2010.

b) Existing issues with GRASS7 (Raster) support will
   be fixed and most of the existing tickets will be
   closed by 1st Dec 2010.

c) ZOO-Kernel-1.2.0RC1  will be released on Dec 2010.
   Problems with RC1 can be reported within 5 working days.
   If no problems are reported ZOO-Kernel-1.2 will be released.
   If problems exist, they will be fixed and we will have an RC2.

d) ZOO-Kernel-1.2.0RC1 will not have any additional features
   except for

**issues with GRASS7 support being resolved.
**Full support for new natural languages (write .po files).
**ZOO GRASS services implementation, examples and docs
**Examples with OpenLayers

e) Subsequent to ZOO-Kernel-1.2.0 release, ZOO-Kernel-1.2.0devel
   will be created.

f) New features to be included in ZOO-Kernel-1.3.0devel before
   next stable release (ZOO-Kernel-1.4.0) are as listed below
