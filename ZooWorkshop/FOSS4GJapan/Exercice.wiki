You know everything now about writting zcfg matadata files and get short pieces of code in <tt>service.c</tt> or <tt>ogr_service_provider.py</tt> depending if you choosen C or Python programming language respectively.

The goal of this exercise is to implement the following multiple geometries services :

*Intersection
*Union
*Difference
*SymDifference

=== C version ===

Your are now invited to edit the <tt>source.c</tt> file you have created during this workshop to add the multiple geometries, using the following OGR C-API functions :

*[http://www.gdal.org/ogr/ogr__api_8h.html#5a271b5c7b72994120e7a6bbc7e7e5cb OGR_G_Intersection](OGRGeometryH, OGRGeometryH)
*[http://www.gdal.org/ogr/ogr__api_8h.html#f58f2cfbdb2497659d2eabea73d3b8a0 OGR_G_Union](OGRGeometryH, OGRGeometryH)
*[http://www.gdal.org/ogr/ogr__api_8h.html#497977bec6ecd9dade7a9694f776be64 OGR_G_Difference](OGRGeometryH, OGRGeometryH)
*[http://www.gdal.org/ogr/ogr__api_8h.html#d6dacf495617a230c6f19950bc415f17 OGR_G_SymmetricDifference](OGRGeometryH, OGRGeometryH)

You can use the <tt>Boundary.zcfg</tt> file as example, rename the <tt>InputPolygon</tt> input to <tt>InputEntity1</tt> and add a similar input named <tt>IntputEntity2</tt>. You are invited to update other values in the ZOO Metadata File to set the proper metadata informations.

=== Python Version ===

Your are invited to edit the <tt>ogr_ws_service_provider.py</tt> file you created during this workshop to add the multiple geometries using the following <tt>osgeo.ogr</tt> <tt>Geometry</tt> methods applied on the first <tt>Geometry</tt> instance :

*Intersection(Geometry)
*Union(Geometry)
*Difference(Geometry)
*SymmetricDifference(Geometry)

You can once again use the <tt>Boundary.zcfg</tt> file as example, rename the <tt>InputPolygon</tt> input to <tt>InputEntity1</tt> and add a similar input named <tt>IntputEntity2</tt>. You are invited to update other values in the ZOO metadata file to set the proper metadata informations.

=== Testing your services ===

Once the multiple geometries Services are deployed on your local environment, please reload the <tt>zoo-ogr.html</tt> file created during the previous section from your browser and test your brand new ZOO Services.
