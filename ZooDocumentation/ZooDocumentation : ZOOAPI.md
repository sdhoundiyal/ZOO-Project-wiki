## ZOO API Documentation {#zoo_api_documentation}

ZOO API is a Javascript library designed to facilitate the WPS Process
creation and chaining. It is designed to work server-side with the
Mozilla foundation
[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript) engine,
[SpiderMonkey](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SpiderMonkey). It uses a
[Proj4js](http://proj4js.org) adaptation for server-side reprojection.
It also allows you to easily convert vector formats
([GML](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/gml),
[KML](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/kml),
[GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html), etc). The API also
allows to simply orchestrate WPS services and offering the ability to
add logic and controls in the chaining.

Here are listed the ZOO API documentation material.
