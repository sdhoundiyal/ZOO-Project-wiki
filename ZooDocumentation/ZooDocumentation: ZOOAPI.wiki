ZOO API is a Javascript library designed to facilitate the WPS Process creation and chaining. It is designed to work server-side with the Mozilla foundation [https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript JavaScript] engine, [https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SpiderMonkey SpiderMonkey]. It uses a [http://proj4js.org Proj4js] adaptation for server-side reprojection. It also allows you to easily convert vector formats ([http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/gml GML], [http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/kml KML], [http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html GeoJSON], etc).
