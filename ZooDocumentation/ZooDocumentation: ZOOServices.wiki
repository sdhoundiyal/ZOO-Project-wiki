=== ZOO Service Documentation ===

Here you'll find documentations about the ZOO Services and ZOO Services Providers.

=== Python ===
You can use python to develop your service, it's possible to use all python library (for example python GDAL/OGR - Numpy/Scipy ), you must only give space to your imagination.<br>
The ZCFG file should contain the following :<br>
<pre>
serviceType = Python
serviceProvider = the name of the Python module to use as a ZOO Service Provider without .py
</pre>

The arguments as passed from the request as dictionary; using '''inputs[''yourVariables''][value]''' it's possible to obtain the value/data and you have the result using '''outputs[''yourVariables''][value]''' (where '''''yourVariables''''' is the name of variables that you are set in the zcfg file); at the end there is '''conf[main][''value'']''' (where '''''value''''' is one of value set in the main.cfg file of ZOO) this parameter is very important to pass tmpPath where you should save the files <br>
When you have '''''yourVariables''''' in python variable you can made what do you have in your mind
