== ZOO API ==

ZOO API is a Javascript library designed to make the WPS Process creation and chaining easier. 

It works server-side using the Mozilla foundation [https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript JavaScript] engine, [https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SpiderMonkey SpiderMonkey]. 

It is based on server-side adaptations of [http://openlayers.org OpenLayers] and [http://proj4js.org Proj4js] adaptation for handling formats and projections. It allows to easily convert vector formats ([http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/gml GML], [http://code.google.com/apis/kml/documentation/ KML], [http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html GeoJSON], etc). 

The ZOO API let you orchestrate WPS services simply and offers the ability to add logic and controls in the WPS chaining.
