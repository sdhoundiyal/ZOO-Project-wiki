    Yes we migrated from Osaka City University (OCU) mailman to OSGeo one.

Is the OSGeo SVN being used for the project?
    We do not use the OSGeo SVN because we already got one in place using the same technology and gracefully hosted at OCU.

Are binary and source downloads available from http://download.osgeo.org ?
    Binary and source downloads are not available on download.osgeo.org cause we do not get access to the FTP server to upload the sources. Note that we try to avoid providing binary versions of our software by now.

=== Community Functioning ===

Is there a functioning user support mechanisms (ie. mailing list)?
    There is firstly the Trac system where users can fill tickets, it is used when required by users and developper community. There is also the mailing list. Unfortunatelly from our experience it seems that more users prefer to use mailing lit rather than Trac but some prefer tickets.

Are source and binary downloads for the package available?
    Yes the source code is available for the package. By now, one package is provided but it is possible that, in future, the source code may be splited in smalled packages (ZOO-Kernel, ZOO-Services and ZOO-API). There is no plan for binary distribution except for the WIN32 platform.

Have project documents been updated to reflect membership in the foundation, and the relationship of the project to the foundation?
    No, I don't think so.

Has an effort been made to brand the project web site with OSGeo foundation web styling and branding marks?
    There was always a link with OSGeo (including branding such as logos) as the ZOO-Project's initial goal was to become a "standardized bus" on top of OSGeo softwares so reference to OSGeo was there from the begining. note that the OSGeo Project in Incubation was added when we was accepted by the board to enter in incubation process. Nevertheless, there was no adaptation by applying a non-existing style.

    Yes, we used the GDAL Project RFC 3 as a base document to create our own, available [http://zoo-project.org/docs/community/developer.html here].  PSC should adopt the document. Committers agreement are coming.
