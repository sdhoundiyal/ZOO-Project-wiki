# ZOO-Community _@_ GSoC _with_ OSGeo

We are floating the project ideas for [ZOO-Project](https://github.com/ZOO-Project/ZOO-Project), [MapMint](https://github.com/mapmint/mapmint) and [MapMint4ME](https://github.com/mapmint/MapMint4ME) projects together at a single wiki page to avoid confusion to the potential contributors. The project ideas are explained in detail below:

_Idea(s):_

## **ZOO-Project**

1. ### Getting ready with ZOO-Project for the OGC Compliance Testing.

The ZOO-Project is a solid WPS server able to handle services implemented in various different programming languages. The existing ZOO-Kernel supports C, C++, and JS implementations. With this project, the objective is to add support for NodeJS implementation of the ZOO-Kernel.

**Mentor**: [Gérald Fenoy](https://www.osgeo.org/member/gerald-fenoy/), [Rajat Shinde](https://www.osgeo.org/member/shinde/), 

**Difficulty**: Expert

**Pre-requisites**: Python, JavaScript, C++, OGC standards

**Expected Outcome**: ZOO-Project 100% ready with OGC compliance tests.

**Time of the project**: 175 or 350 hrs

**Idea in Detail**: We are expecting the following deliverables from the project:

-   ZOO-Project is expected to be ready for successful OGC compliance certification. The selected contributor is expected to contribute to make it 100% ready for testing. This is an open-ended project and requires understanding of the entire project.   

**Test**: Contributors interested in working on this project idea must successfully perform the following tasks in the Contributor application period.

-   Test for the understanding of Github (Version Control)

    -   Fork the [ZOO-Project](https://github.com/ZOO-Project/ZOO-Project) Github repository and create a task list in the issues section of the repository.

-   Create a pull request to the [ZOO-Project](https://github.com/ZOO-Project/ZOO-Project) repository with your code.

The link to the Github repository should be mentioned in the final Contributor proposal for the Google Summer of Code 2023.

## MapMint

1. ### Implementing MapMint dashboard based on ZOO services on the Cloud platform

MapMint is a web-based Geographic Information System (GIS), which is designed to facilitate deployment of Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI). In an SDI, geographic data, metadata, tools, and the users are connected in an interactive manner in a framework so as to use the spatial information in an efficient and flexible way. MapMint combines various different software in a complete and coherent web mapping platform, thus helping users in building their own maps and web-applications. These web-services are built on top of the ZOO-Project. 

**Mentor**:Aditi Sawant, [Gérald Fenoy](https://www.osgeo.org/member/gerald-fenoy/),[  Rajat Shinde](https://www.osgeo.org/member/shinde/)

**Difficulty**: Medium

**Pre-requisites**: Python, JavaScript, 3D Visualization, Azure cloud platform

**Expected Outcome**: Integrated cloud support for the MapMint platform.

**Time of the project**: 175 or 350 hrs

**Idea in Detail**: We are expecting following deliverables from the project:

-   ZOO-Project has been a proud winner of the Microsoft AI for Earth grants. With this project, the idea is to implement the ZOO services stack and algorithms over the Azure cloud and create a containerized setup which could be easy to use and develop.

-   The project would involve implementing MapMint dashboard on the Azure cloud 

**Test**: Contributors interested in working on this project idea have to successfully perform the following tasks in the Contributor application period.

-   Test for the understanding of Github (Version Control)

    -   Fork the[  MapMint](https://github.com/mapmint/mapmint) Github repository and create a task list in the issues section of the repository.

-   Test for the understanding of Azure Cloud

    -   Prove your understanding of the Azure cloud platform. The implementation or development is upto the creativity of the contributor.

-   Create a pull request to the MapMint repository with your code.

The link to the Github repository should be mentioned in the final Contributor proposal for the Google Summer of Code 2023.

## MapMint4ME

1.  ### Implement AR draw support based on OGC ARML standard

MapMint4ME is an android application for the MapMint web service. The android application is built on top of ZOO-Project. ZOO-Project is an open WPS platform. ZOO-Project acts as SDI for the android application and gives users convenience to built their map and application using MapServer and GDAL. The android application MapMint4ME is built on MapMint, so the structure of the data storage and processing is the same, and thus, it is essential to understand the architecture of MapMint. 

**Mentor**: [Rajat Shinde](https://www.osgeo.org/member/shinde/), [Gérald Fenoy](https://www.osgeo.org/member/gerald-fenoy/), Aditi Sawant

**Difficulty**: Expert

**Pre-requisites**: Python, JavaScript, Augmented Reality, OGC Standards

**Expected Outcome**: Updated MapMint4ME app based on OGC ARML standard.

**Time of the project**: 175 or 350 hrs

**Idea in Detail**: We are expecting following deliverables from the project:

-   In 2021, one of the project ideas (https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/GSoC_2021_Building_the_AR_Draw_Experience_with_UNITY_3D_and_Integrating_it_with_the_present_MapMint4ME_App) was to implement AR Draw support inside MapMint dashboard using Unity 3D. With this objective, the aim is to explore the implementation based on the OGC ARML 2.0 standard (https://www.ogc.org/standards/arml) for the AR draw support in the MapMint4ME. 

**Test**: Contributors interested in working on this project idea have to successfully perform the following tasks in the Contributor application period.

-   Test for the understanding of Github (Version Control)

    -   Fork the [MapMint4ME](https://github.com/mapmint/MapMint4ME) Github repository and create a task list in the issues section of the repository.

-   Test for the understanding of Web Services

    -   Implement and present a short report on working with OGC standardized web services - WMS, WFS and WPS from the QGIS interface. Read OGC ARML 2.0 standard.

-   Create a pull request to the MapMint4ME repository with your code.

The link to the Github repository should be mentioned in the final Contributor proposal for the Google Summer of Code 2023.

The Contributors are encouraged to reach out to[  Gérald Fenoy](https://www.osgeo.org/member/gerald-fenoy/) and[  Rajat Shinde](https://www.osgeo.org/member/shinde/) for any queries regarding the above-mentioned test.
